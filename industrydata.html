<h4 style="text-align: left;">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h4>
 <ol style="text-align: left;">
  <li>As a Future Network Security Engineer reading up on the other IT jobs and skillsets my choice on job role is the same as before,
    unless I'm offered an opportunity I could not refuse.</li><br>
  <li>Manufacturing Engineer in areo-space/bio is my ideal position (can't find the perfect combination). The more I manufacture the more
    I want to build things for the future. Manufacturing is one of the places that I feel home, and it challenges me every day. This SpaceX 
    position is something that is achievable. I have a lot of experience in similar things so I would like to stick to this being my ideal job.
    Perhaps not in America, I have never wanted to live there... never say never! Working in manufacturing I have seen a huge shift towards space
    manufacturing. The companies that I worked for develop and test a lot in space gathering that information and use it to create better products.
    The more we visit space the more we learn about its benefits and understand how easy it is to manufacture there without having the restraints
    of Earth. Not just to develop and test things for earth, but to create a place to extract resources close to where we build in space. This is
    very viable and most big companies are investing massive amounts of money in establishing manufacturing bases in space to some capacity or another.
    The bio part comes into manufacturing because in space things are different and it changes the way we do things, including manufacturing. It is not
    big right now, but I imagine there being areas created for this as we adjust to our new environment. I do not really have too many “why not” answers
    because I wouldn’t consider even doing a job I didn’t like in the first place.</li><br>
  <li>Head of IT Manager is my goal and will take all the necessary steps to get to my Ideal job</li><br>
  <li>WEB Developer is my chosen ideal job I haven't changed my mind as of yet </li>
