      <li> Sabina has as great work ethic and enjoys to communicate well using MS teams to work through our Team project, something I found that she can improve in is to
        utilize more html tags to display a better formatted data on a website and to double check her work more carefully before embedding it into the html pages </li><br>
      <li>Christoffel has great IT skills I have learnt a few tricks from Christoffel in a very short amount of time, the favicon icon and navigation tools,
        Excellent Team contributor looking forward to getting onto the next Project</li><br>
      <li>Jordan Has made a great contribution to the IT Topic Section, im unable to rate Jordan as I have not seen enough engadgment through Ms Teams, </li><br>
      <li>Carl is a great team leader. He keeps things moving forward and motivates everyone. Solves problems with the html code. One thing he can improve on
        would be planning around the time zone differences between team members.</li>
