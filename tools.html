<p>We have actively used MS Teams to communicate and resolve issues such as formatting, editing and layout design. Discussed ideas and crossreferenced to 
  the Rubric to follow it as closely as possible along the Exemplary column to achieve maximum marks for our team efforts. It was identified that you can not save
  the channel communication or activity to a pdf file unless your using third party software. Is it possible to make this software available for future group work as
  this will ultimately show a more detailed version of events and who made what contributions to the team. I will provide a link to this information below.
  The name of the software is called AGAT SphereShield, "is keeping pace with the evolution of Teams and the needs of the end-user. The new features of SphereShield
  will further enhance functionality, increase usability, productivity, and adoption of Microsoft Teams".
