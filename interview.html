</p>
  
  
  <h3 style="text-align:left">1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
  <p align="justify">I am employed by DXC Technology as an Account Executive. I work on one of the largest federal government agencies in Australia
    and the 2nd largest account DXC has in the ANZ region. On the account I am responsible for the end-to-end operations finance, governance and sales
    in automation and service management areas across my agencies. We have 5 account executives on this account each responsible for their patch. This means
    I am responsible to build relationships with our client to identify if DXC can partner \ help them with their business problems, opportunities,
    or strategy. Identifying the opportunity is only the first step. The key part of my role is to enroll the client and their stakeholders and other
    departments in how DXC can help them be successful and construct a deal that offers innovation, leading edge, and value for money. Once I sell the deal,
    I am responsible to ensure the deal is delivered well both in project or operations and that we meet our financial obligations both internally in DXC as
    well as with the client.

  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
  <p align="justify">I work in the Information Technology industry. IT is needed by every business in a more meaningful way each year. This makes every
    business an IT business. Therefore, this is the largest industry you could tap into, endless opportunity, innovation, and change. From hospitality,
    transportation, mining, health care, public sector and everything in between every issue, risk and opportunity can be solved with information technology.

  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h3>
  <p align="justify">While majority of my work is with operations, relationships and innovations. Some parts of my work involve contracts and commercials and project management.
Contracts ensure that I am selling something at the correct contracted rates and abide by the contracts we work within.
Commercials infers that I need to construct deals that cannot hurt DXC or my client and that they can be upheld in different scenarios.
Project Management is key to ensure what I am selling to my client can be delivered in the timeframes I promise and enlisting trust in my client is key to our relationship.

  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h3>
  <p align="justify">I work with several internal and external stakeholders<br>
Internally I work with my public sector General Manager (my boss) he tells me my target!! I also work with commercial, legal, contracts and request management – throughout
    the deal process they ensure that everything is up to scratch and my deal is top notch. I work with operations to ensure I am not selling something the team can’t deliver or we don’t have the skills in.<br>
Externally I obviously work with our client. Mainly the stakeholders in my field of innovation, service management and key projects that involve innovation.<br>
I also work with partners that I use to deliver my deals like Google, Vmware, microfocus to ensure my deal is leading edge and we meet the market.


  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h3>
  <p align="justify">My interaction with other IT professionals are described above. Nothing really outside of this.

  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
  <p align="justify">My interaction with my client is very focused on business problems and what is top of mind for them. It is less about IT and more about
    the business problem which needs solving.

  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h3>
  <p align="justify">Most of my time is spent with the client listening to their issues, even sitting on calls where projects are not going well to see if
    there is an IT solution which can address the issues at hand. We also spend a lot of time as a team to create proof of concepts in an AGILE fashion and
    show case these to the client as Demo’s to ensure the customer has them and us front of mind for innovation.

  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
  <p align="justify">The most challenging part of my role is to create an IT solution that is received by different stakeholders on the client side with
    differing points of view or drivers. Meaning the politics involved with putting a deal forward tend to slow progress and create in decision and therefore
    I need to enroll each of them and understand each of their drivers and their concerns and validate these in or out of the deal. This can take months of work.

  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align:left">9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h3>
<p align="justify">On March 18, my client one of the largest government agencies in Australia sent its workforce to work from home. Normally they had a remote
  IT solution to account for only 2,500 people to work remotely simultaneously. Without notice we had to create a solution to upscale this solution to handle
  21,000 remote connections to accommodate the business need. This was also compounded by the announcement of the stimulus package my client was tasked to distribute
  to Australians in need during the COVID 19 pandemic. 130 billion dollars was distributed by my client at the very same time they were all sent home on a remote
  platform which formed within days. This was the largest stimulus package distributed in Australian history.<br>
